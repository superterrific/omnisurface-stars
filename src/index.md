The data was manually compiled as a labor of love among for a group of racing enthusiasts and is by no means a complete representation of horses that meet the "Omnisurface Star" criteria.

The term "Omnisurface Star" was coined to represent a horse that had won on all three Thoroughbred racing surfaces: dirt, synthetic and turf. American racing has moved away from racing on synthetic surfaces over the last decade. See the [About page](/about/) for more information on this project, the rise and demise of synthetic surfaces in American horse racing and a list of people involved with this project.
